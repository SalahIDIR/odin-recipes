        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds lean ground beef</li>
            <li>½ cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
            <li>¼ cup milk</li>
            <li>1 (1 ounce) envelope dry onion soup mix</li>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
