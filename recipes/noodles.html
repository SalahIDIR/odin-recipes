        <h3>This tuna noodle casserole is the best with a classic creamy taste from my <br>childhood. The sauce is rich and creamy but not overwhelmingly heavy. The <br>crunch from the topping and fresh bite from the parsley create the perfect <br>balance. Let's not forget that this is a great budget-friendly meal to feed a <br>crowd!</h3>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking <br>dish.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add egg noodles and 3 teaspoons salt to the <br>boiling water; cook until tender yet firm to the bite, about 6 minutes. Drain<br> noodles. Return to pot and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-<br>high heat. Add mushrooms and onion and cook until mushrooms are softened<br>and onions are translucent, about 4 minutes. Add remaining butter; stir<br>constantly until melted. Sprinkle flour over vegetable mixture and cook, stirring<br>constantly, for 1 minute. Stir in milk and stock and bring to a simmer, stirring<br>often. Simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in lemon juice, Dijon mustard, 1 teaspoon salt,<br>and pepper.</li>
            <li>Add sauce mixture to reserved noodles. Stir in 1 cup Cheddar cheese, peas, and<br>tuna. Pour mixture into the prepared baking dish and sprinkle remaining<br>Cheddar cheese over the top.</li>
            <li>Stir together bread crumbs, remaining 2 teaspoons oil, remaining 1/4 teaspoon<br>salt, and paprika in a small bowl. Sprinkle bread crumb mixture evenly over the<br>casserole.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbly, 25 to 30 minutes. Sprinkle<br>with parsley and serve.</li>
        </ol>
